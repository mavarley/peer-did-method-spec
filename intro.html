<h1>Introduction</h1>

<section class="informative">
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Most documentation about Decentralized Identifiers (DID) describes them as identifiers that are rooted in a public source of truth like a
        blockchain, a database, a distributed filesystem, or similar. This publicness lets arbitrary parties <a
                target="_blank" href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">resolve</a> the DIDs to an endpoint and
        keys. It is an important feature for many use cases.</p>

    <p>However, the vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and things have simpler requirements.
        When Alice<code>(</code>Corp<code>|</code>Device<code>)</code> and Bob want to interact, there are exactly and
        only 2 parties in the world who should care: Alice and Bob. Only Alice and Bob need to resolve their DIDs, instead of arbitrary and 
 	external parties. Peer DIDs are suited for these cases. Peer DIDs allow two or more parties to interact using DID based 
	technologies without the overhead of a common, shared repository or authority. Peer DIDs move the bulk
        of interactions "off-chain" while offering options to connect back to a chain-based ecosystem as needed. This model provides similar benefits to 
	off-chain <a target="cryptoc"
                href="https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/understanding-ethereum/understanding-plasma/">Ethereum Plasma</a>
        or <a target="cryptoc" href="https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/understanding-ethereum/basics-state-channels/">
            state channels</a> are to on-chain smart contracts&mdash; or what <a target="cryptoc"
                href="https://lightning.network/">Bitcoin's Lightning Network</a> is to on-chain cryptopayments.  Peer DIDs create the conditions
        for people, organizations and things to have full control and responsibility of the digital relationships they are engaged in.
    </p>

    <p>The following formal terminology is used herein to make the application of this insight to DIDs clearer:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Anywise</dfn> DID</dt><dd>A DID intended for use with an unknowable number of parties (e.g., the global public
        or some subset thereof).</dd>
        <dt><dfn>Pairwise</dfn> DID</dt><dd>A DID intended to be known by its subject and exactly one other party (e.g., one
        usable in the Alice and Bob example just above).</dd>
        <dt><dfn>N-wise</dfn> DID</dt><dd>A DID intended to be known by exactly <em>N</em> enumerated parties including
        its subject. A business partnership with 3 members might be a modeled with n-wise DIDs. Pairwise DIDs are
        just a special case of an N-wise DID (<em>N</em> = 2). For more on n-wise DIDs, see <a href="#groups-info">
            Groups</a> in the appendices.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Generally, an anywise DID needs to be resolvable by other parties without any previous introduction (i.e. publicly anchored DID). 
	These parties can use the anywise DID to reference its subject (usually by resolving it on a public ledger) without establishing a relationship 
	directly with that subject.
        Pairwise and n-wise DIDs only need to be resolvable by the parties within the relationship, and
        <em>each</em> party in the relationship must contribute a DID to participate. Because of the
        reciprocal nature of DID usage in enumerated relationships like this, we call the parties "peers", and it is this
        dynamic that gives our DID method its name.

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>Peer DIDs have certain properties that make them suitable for private relationships between a small number of
        enumerable parties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They are not subject to shared ledger 'transaction costs', making them essentially free to create, store, and maintain.</li>
        <li>They scale and perform entirely as a function of participants, not with any external system's capacity.</li>
        <li>From a cybersecurity context, there is no trove to protect because they are not persisted in any external collection.</li>
        <li>From a privacy context, concerns about third-party data controllers and processors (and linkability of personal data) are much reduced 
	    because only the parties to a given relationship share the DIDs.
        </li>
        <li>Technical (and possibly political) requirements and obligatons for the use of peer DIDs is minimalized because they are not 
	    coupled or beholden to any particular blockchain or distributed ledger technology.
        </li>
        <li>They can be mapped into the namespaces of other DID ecosystems, allowing a peer DID to have predictable
            meaning in 1 or more other blockchains (see <a href="#grafting">Grafting</a>). This creates an
            interoperability bridge and solves a problem with blockchain forks fighting over the ownership of a DID.
        </li>
        <li> Peer DIDs are well suited to supporting "offline" use cases, such as those defined in <a target="aries"
            href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0116-evidence-exchange/README.md">use cases
            that need a decentralized peer-oriented architecture</a>, as they can be created and maintained for an entire lifecycle without 
	    any reliance on the internet with no degradation of trust. This is because they avoid a dependence on a central source of truth 
            which often sets the often-online requirement that typifies most other DID methods. Peer DIDs thus align closely with
            the ethos and the architectural mindset of the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html"
            target="_blank">local-first</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://offlinefirst.org/">offline-first</a>
            software movements.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Peer DIDs are not suitable for <a>anywise</a> use cases, which are usually public by intent. For more on when peer DIDs 
	do and do not make sense, see <a href="#comparison">Comparison to Other DID Methods</a>
    	in the Appendices.
